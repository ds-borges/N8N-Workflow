# AI Agents and Automations Repository ü§ñ

Welcome to my portfolio of practical Artificial Intelligence and automation projects. This repository is a collection of agents developed to solve real-world problems, organized into categories that demonstrate different AI techniques and applications, from data processing (ETL) to web scraping and answer generation based on specific knowledge (RAG).

Feel free to explore each directory to see the technical details of every project.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Technologies

These projects were developed using a set of modern tools for automation, data processing, and AI:

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The repository is divided into four main categories. Each folder contains its own `README.md` with detailed project documentation.

### ETL_Agent
Agents focused on automating **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** tasks. These workflows connect various APIs and services to automate repetitive processes and manage data flows.
* **Highlights include:** An agent that manages a book database on Supabase, an email classifier that organizes your Google Calendar, and a social media bot for Instagram.

### RAG_Agent
Implementations of the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** architecture. This technique connects Large Language Models to private vector databases, enabling them to answer questions based on specific, reliable documents.
* **Projects:** A legal assistant trained on Brazilian laws and a virtual academic advisor for university regulations, both using Supabase Vector DB to ensure factual answers.

### Web_Scraping
**Web Scraping** projects designed to extract live information from the internet. These agents fetch data from websites and APIs, use AI to process it, and deliver timely insights through messaging apps.
* **Examples:** A daily news summarizer that scrapes political websites and a weather bot that provides local forecasts for Jata√≠-GO via WhatsApp and Telegram.

### Others_Agent
A folder for miscellaneous projects and experiments. This directory serves as a sandbox for testing new ideas, developing one-off scripts, or building prototypes that don't fit neatly into the other categories.
